# Omeka S Lightweight Training Session
## Modfied from a Workshop by [Anna Neatrour](https://gitlab.com/aneatrour/omekas-workshop)

Omeka describes itself as "a web publishing platform for institutions interested in connecting digital cultural heritage collections with other resources online". It is widely used by Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums, sometimes called just GLAM. It  has great documentation and many projects to draw upon for inspiration.

## Omeka Affordances

* Learn how to present information on the web
* Learn how to make your own websites and additional skills like HTML markup. This can be valuable practice if you ever need to write for the web or learn a Content Management System (CMS) for managing web content in the future
* How to shape your narrative to a particular digital tool
* Develop information for a broad audience

## Session Requirements and Technical Information

* You'll have the opportunity later to create a test exhibit in the [Yale Library Omeka S Sandbox](https://onlineexhibits-test.library.yale.edu/)
* Bring a laptop to the workshop (or be at a decent computer on Zoom) so you can fully participate
* You should have received communication from Omeka S about your account, but let me know if not
* Our sandbox (or Test) instance is visible to the world, but is not supposed to be discoverable by search engines. Generally speaking, be aware of whether your site is visible publicly or not.

## Workshop Topics
