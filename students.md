# Learning Omeka {#learning-omeka .entry-title}

## Miriam Posner at UCLA is the best

Her [two-pager quickstart
guide](http://miriamposner.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Up-and-Running-with-Omeka2.pdf)
(PDF)

Her [Programming Historian tutorial for working with
Omeka.net](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka.html).

She and Megan Brett together wrote a [Programming Historian tutorial for
creating an Omeka
exhibit](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit)

## Omeka's Own Documentation

[Tip sheet (especially good for
vocabulary)](https://omeka.org/files/docs/OmekaWorkshopTipSheet.pdf)
from George Mason University, the creator and maintainer of Omeka

## Higher Education Resources

The College of Wooster Library has [one of the better
libguides](https://libguides.wooster.edu/c.php?g=629900&p=4396906) on
getting oriented and started with Omeka.

The [Cornell University Library Guide to Omeka
Basics](http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=299438&p=1999932) is
pretty good, too. Includes a brief rundown of the metadata standard used
in Omeka. Others here have larger explanations of Dublin Core.

Duke University Wired! Lab [Tutorials on Omeka and
Neatline](http://www.dukewired.org/workshops/tutorials/#tab-id-4) A
handful of documents that are reasonably good. Not all are
non-duplicative with other links here

## A Slightly Irreverent Tutorial

A [blog post walkthrough that claims to be for
"millennials"](https://lilybeauvilliers.wordpress.com/2015/05/14/omeka-for-millenials/),
but with a more positive cast to that categorization than many give it.

## Student Reflections on Working with Omeka/Neatline

UMD Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture, Omeka/Neatline
Roundtable: [Part I, Goals and
Audience](https://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/blog/omekaneatline-roundtable-part-i-goals-and-audience)
and [Part II, Technicalities and
Takeaways](http://michellesmithcollaboratory.umd.edu/blog/omekaneatline-roundtable-part-ii-technicalities-and-takeaways)

Students talk about their work with Omeka and Neatline, the whys and why
nots. Even if you don't anticipate working with Neatline, their thoughts
on it are intertwined with their reflections on Omeka generally.
